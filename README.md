# NspiredMachining

An attempt to port the PyMachining project to the TI Nspire CX ii calc. Assume this is an entirely non-functional WIP until noted in the README. 

# TODO

- [ ] Replace numpy with the calculator's built-in math functions
- [ ] Replace pylab with the built-in plotting libraries
 - [ ] perhaps just remove in the interim?
- [ ] Bring pint in
